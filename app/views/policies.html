                        3.1 You Have Sole Responsibility When Interacting with Other Members. Our Services provide a
                        platform for members to learn about one another, arrange flights, engage in activities and
                        communicate with one another. Pilot Connect is not a party to, has no involvement or interest
                        in, makes no representations or warranties as to, and has no responsibility or liability with

                        between you and any other member, person or organization. You are solely responsible for your
                        interactions with other members of our Services. We reserve the right, but have no obligation,
                        to monitor interactions between you and other members of our Services.

                    <p>
                        Remember, Pilot Connect Services are just a platform that enable you to communicate and
                        interact with other people around the world. We cannot be responsible for the interactions that
                        you have with other Pilot Connect members, so please use good judgment and keep safety in mind
                        when you use our Services.

                        3.2 Identity Verification. We cannot and do not confirm each member’s identity. You are solely

                        through our Services. Pilot Connect does not represent or warrant that our tools are

                        interacting with other members, particularly when meeting a stranger in person for the first
                        time.

                        You’ve probably arrived on this page because you’re interested in using the logo or other
                        trademarks of Pilot Connect. That’s great! One of the most unique things about Pilot Connect is
                        how many cool projects, events and art pieces are created by our members. We’re thrilled that
                        you want to share Pilot Connect with the world, and we want to make it easy for you to do so.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The trademarks of Pilot Connect (also referred to in this Trademark Policy as “us” or “we”)
                        include ‘Pilot Connect’ the Pilot Connect logo and a few other terms, phrases and logos that you
                        might see around the Pilot Connect websites, mobile apps, etc. Collectively, these are called
                        the “Marks”. The rights to these Marks belong to Pilot Connect, and we are required by law to
                        monitor their use.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Monitoring our Marks allows us to protect our name and logo and prevent confusion for our
                        members. For example, if someone started a tour company called “Pilot Connect Tours”, our members
                        might accidentally assume they were affiliated with us. We want to ensure this doesn’t happen
                        and enable us to ask them to change their name. If many people use the Pilot Connect Marks
                        without adhering to our guidelines, even for worthwhile projects, the ability of the Pilot
                        Connect Marks to function properly weakens over time. When that happens, it affects your ability
                        to know with confidence what offerings are truly and genuinely associated with Pilot Connect and
                        our community.

                    <p>
                        Pilot Connect allows for our Marks to be used in quite a few ways, as we outline below. We
                        generally don’t allow the Marks to be used in ways other than what is listed in this Trademark
                        Policy, but if you have a use that you don’t see covered, please feel free to contact us

                        Having a trademark allows us to protect our name and logo and prevent confusion for our members.
                        For example, if someone started a tour company called “Pilot Connect Tours”, our members might
                        accidentally assume they were affiliated with us. We want to ensure this doesn’t happen. If many
                        people use the Pilot Connect Marks without adhering to our guidelines, even for worthwhile
                        projects, the ability of the Pilot Connect Marks to function properly weakens over time, as does
                        your ability to know with confidence what offerings are truly and genuinely associated with
                        Pilot Connect and our community.

                    the goods and services provided under the Marks. Upon written notification by Pilot
                    Connect of noncompliance with Pilot Connect’s quality standards in any material
                    respect, you shall take appropriate steps, in a commercially reasonable time frame,
                </p>
                <p>

                    5. Use of the Marks shall create no rights for you in or to the Marks or their use
                    beyond the terms and conditions of this limited and revocable license. The Marks shall
                    remain at all times the sole and exclusive intellectual property of Pilot Connect. You
                    hereby assign all right, title and interest in and to any revised or altered Marks to
                    Pilot Connect. Pilot Connect shall have the right, from time to time, to request
                    samples of use of the Marks from which it may determine compliance with these terms and
                    conditions. Without further notice, Pilot Connect reserves the right to prohibit use
                    of the Marks if it determines, in its sole discretion, that your usage of the Marks,
                    whether willful or negligent, is not in strict accordance with the terms and conditions
                    of this license, otherwise could discredit Pilot Connect or tarnish its reputation and
                    goodwill, or that you are not a Pilot Connect member in good standing.
                </p>

                    6. Any questions concerning use of the Marks or the terms and conditions of this license
